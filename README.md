# lol_chat_settings
Set your LoL Chat Status.

This software has as purpose to make easier the status change of League of Legends's chat, through Firewall, blocking the port that connects with the chat server, therefore, disconnecting with this server.

It blocks the chat, preventing from send and receiving messages, except in-game.

[This software doesn't modify the game, it only manages the Windows firewall.]

The usage of this software doesn't result in ban, or port blocking, as it doesn't violate none of Riot Games's rules.

! Set as Offline, blocking the chat port, also affects the chat, making unable to send and receive messages. !

!! PS: Be careful when using on Blind Pick mode, because you won't see the messages from another users in Champion Selection screen, may end up trolling unintentionally on picks. !!

In-game the chat works normally, being able to send and receive messages, because the chat in-game uses another connection.

!!! DO NOT TAKE RESPONSABILITY FOR BANISHMENT, MAKE A CONSCIOUS USE OF THIS SOFTWARE !!!


*Run as Administrator
It works only when you "Run as Administrator", because to manage the firewall it is necessary the administrator privileges*

**In startup, it forces the firewall activation.

Options on menu:

1 - Online 
[Set your status to Online, disable the firewall rule that blocks the chat port]

2 - Offline
[Set your status to Offline, enable the firewall rule that blocks the chat port]

8 - Install
[Adds the firewall rule that blocks the chat port]

9 - Uninstall
[Deletes the firewall rule that blocks the chat port]

0 - Exit
[Exit the program].

***To avoid complications, before changing the status, it is recommended closing League of Legends first.

League of Legends's system has a function that verifies from time to time the player's status (Online/Away/Offline)
Because if that, if the game is opened, the status change will only be effected in the next status verification.
As LoL doesn't have this option, natively, of changing the status online/offline, it may have bugs on client.

To force the Online status, click several times in the messages icon, avatar change, text status change, or try sending messages, anything to force the system to recognize that you're Online.
To force Offline status, the same procedure, but it will be online to others, until the status verification time.
